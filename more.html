  <p style="font-size:20px; color: blue; gont-family: bold;>Nagas have split tongues caused by licking grass on which the Garuda spilled the nectar of eternal life. With a human face and the hood and body of a cobra, Nagas live underground in caves and sometimes in jeweled palaces. The Naga king has a thousand heads which serve as an umbrella for the sleeping Buddha. Unlike the serpent of Christian stories these serpents are not seen as evil. In some stories Nagas and the Garuda are depicted as enemies, where the Garuda perpetually punishes Nagas. But in Cambodia the Naga is revered as the ancestor of the Cambodian people and the protector of the Buddha. In Buddhist belief, Nagas are often seen as local deities, with the belief being that they use their powers to assist people. And in South India, Nagas can bring fertility, where women seek their aid in having children. </p>
